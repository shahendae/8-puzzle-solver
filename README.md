# 8-puzzle-solver
The puzzle consists of an area divided into a grid, 3 by 3 for the 8-puzzle. On each grid
square is a tile, expect for one square which remains empty. Thus, there are eight tiles in
the 8-puzzle. A tile that is next to the empty grid square can be moved into the empty space,
leaving its previous position empty in turn.
Using Informed and Uninformed Search Algorithms Constructed BFS and DFS implementation to eight puzzle search problem. Conducted A star search algorithm using manhattan distance heuristic and euclidean
distance heuristic.
